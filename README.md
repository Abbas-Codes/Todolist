# Todolist

Add a new list item by typing in the text input then clicking on the add button, you can also add a new list by typing in the search bar:

```/example```

name the list whatever you want.

I'll soon update it so then you will be able to create accounts so that no one can peek at you todolist and I will also make the new list easier to be made
